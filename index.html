      <h2>Types of Data Transmission</h2>
      <p>There are two main types of data transmission, parallel and serial transmission. In serial transmission, one bit is transmitted at a time. In parallel transmission, multiple bits are transmitted at the same time. Parallel transmission is faster than serial transmission. Serial data transmission has mostly replaced parallel transmission because it is safer and more reliable. It is also less expensive and can transmit data over long distances which is more improtant today with our global internet. The USB or universal serial bus, is a great example of serial transmission. Parallel transmission is still used but mostly inside of computers connecting computer components. The distance to travel is shorter so there is less room for errors. The integrated circuits or IC is one example of where parallel transmission is still used. Below you can see a diagram of serial on the left and parallel on the right.</p>
